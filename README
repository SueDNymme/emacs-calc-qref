*** Eric's Gnu Emacs Calc Quick-Reference Guide ***

[This file describes v1.02 of the guide, of 2015 MAY 18]

This is a quick-reference booklet for the "calc" command that is
distributed with Gnu Emacs.  It is meant to be printed and folded
into a little booklet that you keep by your computer, but you can
also leave it in PDF form and refer to it that way.


** How to make the booklet

  1. Print the 4-up document on both sides of the paper (duplex).
     If your printer does not do two-sided printing, you'll need
     to feed the pages through a second time, or whatever it is
     you do to get duplex printing on your printer.

  2. Cut each sheet in half across the short dimension (widthwise).
     One side of each page has a guide line; cut along that.

  3. Arrange the pages in the proper order.

  4. Staple the booklet together, in the center, where the binding
     fold will be.  One side of the booklet has guide marks where
     the staples should go.

     Most ordinary staplers aren't long enough to reach the marks.
     For me, the following works: Gently fold part of one page toward
     the center, then slip that folded part between the base and arm
     of the stapler.  Staple the booklet on the guide marks, then
     unfold the page and smooth it out.

  5. Fold the booklet in half, right where you stapled it.
     You may want to rest a heavy book upon it overnight.

  6. Finally, trim the edges of the booklet with a razor blade
     or good scissors.

Alternatively, if you don't mind a larger booklet, print the 2-up
edition of the document and assemble it similarly.
